# raytracer
A playground for experimenting with raytracing in rust.

![](https://github.com/cwbriones/raytracer/workflows/ci/badge.svg)

This is primarily based on Peter Shirley's [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) book series, with some modifications as I learn about raytracers more generally.

So far I've implemented everything in the first book, with the addition of BVH acceleration structure as described in [PBR](http://www.pbr-book.org/3ed-2018/Primitives_and_Intersection_Acceleration/Bounding_Volume_Hierarchies.html).
